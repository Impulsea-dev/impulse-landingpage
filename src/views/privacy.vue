  <p class="text-sm">Impulse Limited (“Impulse”) is a global company with its headquarters in Grand Cayman that develops, implements, and supports proprietary customer care and solutions for service providers within telecommunications sectors in 40+ countries.</p>

  <p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to Impulse Limited, as set out in the Appendix. It sets out Impulse’s policy on the management of personal data. </p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">1. OPEN AND TRANSPARENT MANAGEMENT OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
  <p class="text-sm">Impulse is committed to ensuring that it is open and transparent about the way it manages personal data. Set out in this Privacy Policy is the following important information regarding our management of your personal data:</p>
  <ul class="list-decimal ml-8">
    <li>The kinds of personal data that Impulse collects and holds</li>
    <li>How Impulse collects personal data and the purposes for which Impulse collects, holds and uses personal data; </li>
    <li>Who Impulse discloses personal data to;</li>
    <li>How an individual may access its personal data that is held by Impulse and seek the correction of such information;</li>
    <li>How an individual may complain about a privacy issue or alleged breach of privacy and how Impulse will deal with such a complaint.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">2. PERSONAL DATA IMPULSE COLLECTS AND USES</h2>
  <p class="text-sm">Impulse will only collect personal data that is necessary for its business functions and activities. It will only collect personal data by lawful and fair means and not in an obtrusive way. Impulse collects and holds different categories of personal data depending on the purposes for which it is collected and processed. We ensure that our staff are trained in regard to their obligations in handling personal data.</p>
  <p class="text-sm">The following types of personal data may be collected and processed:</p>
  <ul class="list-decimal ml-8">
    <li>Information about partners, customers (including potential partners and customers) and their employees and customers</li> 
  </ul>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">When your company becomes a partner, customer, or prospective customer or partner of Impulse, then, in the course of establishing the business relationship, we may collect personal data about certain customer employees such as name, work location, employer, position, and business contact details. We may collect this information when you or your organization give it to us directly, when we receive it from our partners or suppliers who are allowed to share your information with us, when you use our products and services, or visit our website.</p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">All personal data collected by Impulse is solely used for our legitimate business functions and activities. It may be used to the extent that it is necessary for us to carry out our business of the supply of our products / solutions and services and to provide you with information in relation to our products/ solutions, services, or other information that you may have requested. For example: </p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">We may collect and store information about the training you take for our products in order to provide you with appropriate credentials and to be able to verify authorised users.</p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">We may take down the details and notes of business meetings and may share this information within Impulse globally on a need-to-know basis. </p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">When you as a customer contact impulse for support services, your phone call may be recorded for administrative and quality assurance purposes. </p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">We may use the information we collect to analyse, improve and develop our products and services including contacting you for customer satisfaction surveys. </p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">Where you participate in a webinar, you understand and agree that other participants may see the information you provide in the shared webinar platform and that the webinar may be recorded for future purposes, including making available for future training. </p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">Sometimes, as part of a service being provided to a customer, Impulse may also collect and retain, on behalf of that customer, personal data relating to that customer’s customers. In that scenario, Impulse is a data processor, and Impulse and the customer will have a Data Processing Agreement in place. The personal data of the end customer will be collected directly from Impulse’s customer and may include, name, billing address, contact and account information and meter data. An example of this would be when Impulse provides hosting or managed solutions on behalf of a customer or where we provide support or maintenance services for our customers, and it is not reasonably practical to use anonymised materials. This personal data is solely held in accordance with our customer’s requirements and instructions so that we can facilitate provision of the services our customers have requested. If you are a current or former customer of one of Impulse’s customers and you wish to access, correct, amend, or delete your personal data, please direct your request to the applicable Impulse customer first (ie, to the company which collected your personal data from you), and then, if no satisfactory response is received, please contact: privacy@impulse.ky. Impulse will work with our customer to endeavour to resolve your request. </p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">We will retain such personal data that we process on behalf of our customers only for as long as is needed to provide our services. </p>
  <ul class="list-decimal ml-8">
    <li>Recruitment</li>     
  </ul>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">In connection with a job application or inquiry, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as your name, address, contact information, resume, cover letter and your references. We may request you to send a video application, complete a task relevant to the job applied for and take notes during interviews with you. We may also require your social security number, passport copy or other relevant right-to-work documentation in order to verify your working rights in the country you’ve applied for employment. In addition, where consented by you, we may process information about your disability in order to accommodate you. </p>
    <p class="text-sm mt-2">In some cases, we may receive your personal data from our recruitment suppliers, to whom you have given the permission to share your information with us, or you may send your application to us through an external job application software or integration provider. We may also share your personal data with and receive it from third parties where we, for example, do background checks, including police checks (as permitted by local laws), verify your visa status, references, or qualifications, or arrange pre-employment assessments, such as personality tests with external providers. </p>
    <p class="text-sm mt-2">We may use your information throughout Impulse globally in order to address your inquiry or consider you for employment purposes, to market our events, send you surveys related to our recruitment process, and perform analysis on our job applicant base. By submitting your application, you consent to the processing of your personal data as set out in this privacy policy. Unless you tell us not to do so, we may keep your information for future consideration in accordance with our retention policy. </p>
    <p class="text-sm mt-2">If you are offered and accept employment with Impulse, the personal data collected during the recruitment process may be included in your employment record and be retained in accordance with Impulse’s retention policy. Employees should liaise with their HR contact to obtain a copy of the separate employee data privacy policy. </p>
  <ul class="list-decimal ml-8 mt-2">
    <li>Information about Impulse’s contractors and suppliers and their employees </li>     
  </ul>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">Impulse may collect personal data of our contractors and suppliers. This personal data may include name and business contact details so that we can contact them. </p>
  <p class="text-sm italic mt-2">If personal data is not provided </p>  
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">If you do not provide us with your personal data when requested, this may limit the assistance we are able to provide to you. For example, we may not be able to provide the product or service you may have requested, to handle enquiries in connection with those products or services, or to proceed with your application. </p>  
  <p class="text-sm italic mt-2">Personal data of third parties </p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">If you provide us personal data about any person other than yourself, you must ensure that they understand how their personal data will be used, and that they have given their permission for you to disclose it to us and for you to allow us, and our suppliers (as applicable), to use it as set out in this Privacy Policy. </p>
  <p class="text-sm italic mt-2">Legal basis </p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">Impulse may process personal data for Impulse Group’s legitimate business purposes, such as the performance of a contract (including pre-contractual measures), to comply with Impulse’s legal obligations and as required for Impulse’s legitimate interests e.g., to conduct and organise business, protect its legal interests and secure its IT environment. In some cases, the processing of personal data is based on your consent. </p>
  <p class="text-sm italic mt-2">Sensitive personal data </p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">We will only collect sensitive data about you where we have obtained your consent to do so, or we are required or authorised by law to do so. </p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">3. QUALITY OF PERSONAL DATA </h2>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">Impulse will ensure, to the extent reasonably possible, that personal data collected, used, or disclosed is accurate, up-to-date, complete, and relevant. If Impulse becomes aware that any of the personal data it holds is inaccurate, it will take prompt steps to update its records so that those records are correct. Please be aware that in circumstances where Impulse is processing personal data on behalf of a customer of Impulse (as described above) we are unable to correct incorrect personal data, but we will work with our customer in regard to correcting any inaccuracy. </p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">4. DATA SECURITY </h2>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">Impulse takes reasonable steps to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal data it holds from misuse, interference, loss and unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure. </p>
  <p class="text-sm mt-2">All personal data is stored at secure premises and is accessed only by authorised personnel for permitted purposes. Electronic personal data is stored using quality data management tools and IT security systems and controls including encryption, passwords, and firewalls. Our security systems are regularly reviewed and audited so that we can identify any potential security weaknesses and take steps to promptly rectify them. </p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">5. DIRECT MARKETING </h2>
<p class="text-sm mt-2">Impulse will only engage in direct marketing practices in accordance with the law. At any time, you can request to no longer receive any marketing material or information from Impulse via email or the unsubscribe link in our marketing emails. </p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">6. DISCLOSURE AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA, AND TRANSFERS TO THIRD COUNTRIES </h2>
<p class="text-sm mt-4">
  In order to perform activities in connection with the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, we may make your personal data available to other persons or entities, or disclose it to them, including our suppliers and service providers and any other third parties notified to you in connection with the collection of your personal data.
</p>
<p class="text-sm mt-4">
  Some of the information you provide to us may be transferred cross border for Impulse’s legitimate business purposes and only on a need-to-know basis. Impulse will primarily rely on adequacy decisions but there may also be transfers to a “third country” that may not be covered by an adequacy decision by the European Commission or the competent authority of your country. In most instances, the transfers will be to an affiliated company within the Impulse Group (these are listed in the Appendix) given the global nature of Impulse’s business but may also include third parties as described herein.
</p>
<p class="text-sm mt-4">
  Wherever transfers of personal data to third countries occurs (even if it is to another company within the Impulse Group), Impulse puts in place appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data and transfers your personal data in compliance with the applicable data privacy laws. Impulse has entered into the EU standard contractual clauses (and the UK equivalent) (the “SCCs”) where required. A copy of the relevant SCCs is available to the data subject upon request.
</p>

<p class="text-sm mt-4">
  Where personal data is transferred within Impulse, Impulse applies the same security measures globally. We use our best endeavours to ensure that the third parties we engage with implement technical and organisational measures consistent with our own measures. In addition, we undertake data security due diligence on our partners and ensure that these partners conform to appropriate accreditations.
</p>
<p class="text-sm mt-4">
  We will not sell, rent, or lease personal information to third parties other than business partners or agents. We will not disclose such information to business partners without first letting you know and offering you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit disclosure to that business partner. We will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you wish to opt out of all disclosures to business partners.
</p>

<p class="text-sm mt-4">
  We will only transfer personal information to our agent in order that such agent processes personal data pursuant to our instructions and only after assuring that the agent has privacy policies in effect for such personal data which are at least as stringent as those contained in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p class="text-sm mt-4">
  We may also share your data with professional advisers such as our lawyers and insurers to manage risks and legal claims.
</p>
<p class="text-sm mt-4">
  Impulse will cooperate with all third parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights. We will also cooperate with lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements from within or outside your country of residence, for example, Impulse is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This may include disclosing your personal information to government or law enforcement agencies, or private parties, when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is required by law or when we, in our discretion, believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our legal rights, or those of third parties and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, fraud reduction or legal process served on us. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. These uses of your personal data are in our legitimate interests of protecting our business security.
</p>
<p class="text-sm mt-4">
  Personal data will only be retained for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is collected and processed, to comply with Impulse’s legal obligations (such as financial regulation) and for Impulse’s legitimate interests, such as defending itself against legal claims. Personal data is retained in accordance with Impulse’s data retention policy and, when no longer needed, reasonable steps are taken to securely delete the personal data.
</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">7. WEBSITE BROWSING </h2>
<p class="text-sm mt-4">Impulse’s website uses ‘cookies’ to keep track of your user session on our site for statistical purposes and will result in some information being logged including the time of access, your IP address and the pages that have been viewed or accessed. If you reject cookies, you can still use our website, but your ability to use some features may be limited. </p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">8. YOUR RIGHTS  </h2>
<p class="text-sm mt-4">Your exact rights are subject to the data privacy laws that are applicable to you. The following rights relate specifically to EU and UK data subjects. Subject to verification of your identity, if we hold personal data about you then you may make a request to access, update or correct this personal data at any time. </p>
<p class="text-sm mt-4">You may also request that we remove any personal data that we may hold. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data for example where you consider that we do not need it any longer for the purposes for which we originally collected it as explained to you in this Privacy Policy, where you have withdrawn your consent to our using it and we had relied on that consent according to this Privacy Policy, where you consider that we cannot show a ‘legitimate interest’ in continuing to process it and we have relied on that legitimate interest to process it as explained to you in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p class="text-sm mt-4">You may have the right to object to us continuing to use or disclose your personal data, where we are relying on a legitimate interest, (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to obtain restriction of processing. </p>
<p class="text-sm mt-4">If you have provided your consent to the collection, processing, and transfer of your personal data, you have the right to fully or partly withdraw your consent. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you originally consented unless there is another legal ground for the processing. </p>
