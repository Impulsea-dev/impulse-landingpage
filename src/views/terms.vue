          <p class="text-sm"><strong><em>How do I accept the Contract with Impulse and when does the Contract
                commence?</em></strong></p>
          <p class="text-sm">The Contract commences and becomes effective once both parties have signed the contract. By
            accepting the Contract, you are also agreeing to the terms and conditions contained in any Orders/Materials.
            Your
            continued use of a Service will be your acceptance of such terms and conditions and these TOS.</p>

          <p><strong><em>Who can make changes to the Contract and how?</em></strong></p>
          <p>Only Impulse can make changes to the Contract. Impulse may change the Contract after any Fixed Service Period
            by
            giving you at least 30 days advance notice of the change via mail, fax, e-mail or made available
            electronically.
            <strong>You will be bound by revised versions of this Contract that we send to you</strong>. Your continued
            use
            of

            Service
            will begin on the Commencement Date, and will expire at the end of the Fixed Service Period, as applicable
            ("<strong>Initial Service Period</strong>"). Upon expiration of an Initial Service Period, the Service will
            continue on a Month-to-Month Service Period at Impulse then-applicable rates unless you cancel the applicable
            Service or unless Impulse or you terminate this Contract.</p>

            fee
            for any Service(s) you terminate prior to the end of any Fixed Service Period. The fees are equal to
            <strong>50%
              of the total monthly charges for each early terminated Service, multiplied by the number of months left in
              the
              Fixed Service Period</strong>.
